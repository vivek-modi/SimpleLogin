# Simple login

This is a sample project for the ["Make your Android application work on iOS"](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/integrate-in-existing-app.html) tutorial. Master branch contains the project's initial state: it's a simple Android application generated with the Android Studio "Login application" wizard. You could find the final state with the iOS application and shared KMM module in the [final branch](https://github.com/Kotlin/kmm-integration-sample/tree/final)
